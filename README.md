Spreading positive vibes to the universe
My name is Richard Anthony Swanson. I am currently a mess. An emotional rollercoaster which is stuck upside-down but for some reason I'm still smiling. Why? 'Cause I know that it will get better because I know I have not done the work yet. All the blessing I receive has come without really trying that much. As much as I can lie to myself and say I have worked my ass off I know I have not. I want to change and do better for myself and for my loved one's around me. I want them to be proud of me. And I want them to see the change in me without them having to ask a question. More importantly I want to do better for myself. I deserve a break from the pain from such a simple task as getting up. I want each interaction with the outside world to be a positive one. 
I will be honest, compassionate, reliable, genuine, present, loyal, respectful, creative, kind, generous
From this happiness and love will have no choice but flow from my heart to everything in the outside world. 
I want to learn again. Learning, growing, evolving is the only thing that makes me feel sane.
